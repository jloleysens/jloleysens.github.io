### Introduction

Rich Hicky gave an [insightful talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug) on the role of type systems. In it he
presents incisive commentary on the use of exhaustive typing enforced by
languages like Haskell. Strict typing in programming languages reveals, as he
outlines for us, that at a high-level programming is the process of
automating tasks and procedures that exist _in an evolving domain_.

Programs excel at automating repetitive tasks. With the advent of
more advanced techniques such as Machine Learning we see computers automating
fuzzy, high-level tasks. On the spectrum from simple to sophisticated we may have
"add these two numbers together" vs "recognise this person in this crowd of faces". The thing both
of these tasks have in common is that they exist within a specific problem space.

The thing I find interesting about both of these problems is that as a software developer
you are generally engaging in two kinds of activities while going about implementing your
program in these spaces: puzzle solving or
