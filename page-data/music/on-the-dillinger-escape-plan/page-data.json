I have probably listened to roughly 80% of their discography\nand I was enraptured by their unique style that sought to undo many of the\ncomforts we have in conventional song-writing and musicianship.</p>\n<p>Some years ago I was playing a video game called Bioshock in which you — the\nprotagonist — crash land in the middle of the ocean in the opening chapter.\nThe cause of your misfortune is not disclosed. The still floating, burning\nwreckage that was your plane is slowly sinking and so you are encouraged to\nalight. Into the nebulous ocean waters.</p>\n<p>Fortunately a tower in the middle of the ocean is within swimming distance,\nit is your only hope for survival. After dragging your apparently capable\nself out of the ocean waters you enter the base of the tower. A banner\nreading “No gods or kings. Only man.” greets you. From here things get pretty\ncrazy. An elevator takes you to an undersea city where the brightest\nscientific minds have created a safe haven for pushing the limits of what\nhumanity can achieve. Unfettered by scruples, all fronts of scientific\nadvancement have been pushed to dizzying heights. Humans have been augmented.\nThey can run faster, they are much stronger and they can shoot fire from\ntheir finger-tips (because why not!?). Sub-human creatures act as enforcers\nof an unspoken law. However, all is not well in Rapture.</p>\n<p>Greed and narcissism have won out over nobler pursuits. Self-improvement and\nself-glorification have enticed inhabitants of Rapture to set totalitarian\ngoals leaving many scraping the bottom of the barrel. Medicaments that\naugment abilities are also highly addictive which fostered a group insanity\nwithin the populace. Their dignity stripped as well as their pockets. This is\nwhere you enter.</p>\n<p>Cue the track “Fix your face” from TDEPs album “Ire Works”<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p>Delving deeper still into the mysteries of Rapture I continued to listen to\nTDEP. A better musical match for the peculiar horrors in this underworld is a\ntall order. Like the denizens of rapture, TDEP is truly manic and\nschizophrenic. Their track “Lurch”, a song about a stalker reflecting on the\nobject of his desire is as creepy as it is frantic - “…your picture in my pocket I’m obsessed\nwith you”.</p>\n<p>Amidst this swirling chaos there are songs that are truly moments of quiet\nclarity. None more so than, to my mind, the title track from “Dissociation”.\nTracks like these invite a more reflective and personal mode, albeit\nremaining true to the off-kilter sound TDEP work tirelessly to reproduce. A\ncombination of two drum tracks in the chorus drawing in and out of the left\nand right sides of the stereo image create a sense of being in two states\nsimultaneously. Two-minds. Indecision. Ambiguity. Two narratives, not\nintended to co-exist but somehow co-existing regardless. I have not heard a\nbetter musical representation of these concepts which speaks to the maturity\nTDEP achieved later in the bands career.</p>\n<p>From a sound perspective, TDEP have opted for more barky, rock-sounding\nguitars - with blazingly high gain to be sure. They are not a <em>metal band</em> but\nthey are also not quite, only a <em>hardcore band</em>. They have created a specific\nsound. All of these reasons are why TDEP are special and have become an\nirreplaceable part of the kind of music I have come to love.</p>\n<p>I leave you with a final recommendation to listen to the track “When Good\nDogs Do Bad Things” from “irony is a dead scene”. It is one of my personal\nfavorites and an uncharacteristically long song for TDEP. It showcases their\ndynamism while staying true to the narrative they would go on to develop.</p>\n<p>R.I.P. TDEP.</p>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>How is this from 2007?</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"On The Dillinger Escape Plan","date":"April 10, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"category":"music","slug":"/music/on-the-dillinger-escape-plan/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/music/the-chariot/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On The Chariot"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["3447870804","63159454"]}
