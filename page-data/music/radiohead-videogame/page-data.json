Although I am not a Radiohead “expert”,\ntheir music has stuck with me for 20+ years. I’ve tried to analyse and assimilate the ideas in their music\nto my experience at different points in my life but for whatever reason I felt\nthe urge to write down my thoughts on the final track “Videotape” from\n“In Rainbows” today — about 18 years after it’s release.</p>\n<p>“Videotape” with it’s haunting piano refrain always captivated me. The song has a\ncomplex composition yet simple execution. Using the addition of layers to build it’s tortured crescendo.\nIt’s a melancholy <em>sounding</em> song to be sure. The lyrics, which I intend to analyse in this post, push this sense of melancholy\nto a fever-pitch of loss and disassociation. The beautiful rawness of the music\nspeaks to a present (or future?) tragedy.</p>\n<p>When this song was written, at a guess,\nin the years 2004-2007, social network technologies like Facebook will have been\navailable to the wider public for only a few months. Thus, taking cognisance of my vantage point in 2025, I do not think the\nform and virality of social media with us today would have informed the concept\nbehind “Videotape”. This makes “Videotape” all the more beautiful. Apropos the life-world many individuals inhabit this song was prophetic. Radiohead noticed\nthe direction the likes of social media was heading\nand foretell a future where the very thing that it means to be human would be altered. Or, rather, improverished. A core\ntheme in this song is <strong>loss</strong> and a willful choosing of said loss.</p>\n<p>As many other Radiohead songs, “Videotape” explores the human condition in the context of modernity.\nA special focus is placed on how technology interacts with our projections of ourselves\nbut also our most intimate constructions of ourselves. This self that self-perceives\nalso perceives the other through a <em>technologically mediated</em> experience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I’m at the pearly gates… Mephistopheles is just beneath and he’s reaching up to grab me</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The opening line is an unmistakable reference to the Faustian bargain. The “pearly gates” is a sarcastic reference to heaven or utopia.\nThis heaven is the utopia that many Internet technologists of the past 25+ years\nhave been working feverishly to realise. Maximising convenience and enabling humans to\n“be in touch” despite the constraints of time and distance. As we struggle toward and appear to reach this “heaven”,\nthe devil always pulls us out of it. The paradisal fruits turn to ash in our mouths. Detective Rust, in season one of “True Detective”, warns his partner about the fatal problem in\nprosperity Gospel prevelant in parts of America at the time: you are speeding toward a red light. Why is it\nthat we are set up to fail so spectacularly? Because humans are capable of incredible acts of self-delusion when\npresented with the right incentives. Is this too pessimistic an idea? I don’t think so. Self-delusion has spurred\npeople on to great acts of heroism and bravery, but it also makes us susceptible to bullshit. And like Faust, we are, and have been experiencing the fruits of the bargain we accepted based on the bullshit we were sold and bought into. Based on the promise of experiencing heaven.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is one for the good days and I have it all here in red, blue, green…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>…but we will be able to watch it prefectly reproduced, in “red, blue, green”. Every pixel on a screen creates a color by adjusting the strength\nof the colors red, blue and green (more commonly RGB) to emit light of a specific color value. This is the thing you ultimately see\non your screen. This line is dripping in sarcasm. “I have it all”… what you have is <em>nothing</em>. You do not even have\nthe ability to experience your life first-hand. You merely have an obssession with— and addiction to\nthe technology that will mediate all of your experience and experiences of memory. We have departed from the deeply imperfect human\nway of remembering, ultimately rendered in narrative, to the inhuman “remembering” done <em>for us</em> by a machine. You have\nno need of sapiential storytelling, listening or learning. Don’t worry, I can just Google/ChatGPT it. It’s faster and more accurate. This\nis one of the other themes related to the unique <em>process of loss</em> at play here: a kind of hollowing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are my centre when I spin away out of control on videotape</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The whirlwind of confusion and distortion brought by web 2.5 technologies will cause\nus to lose control in an increasingly public fashion. It will be “on videotape” for\nall to see and dissect with ever increasing precision and detail. But I think the\nmore insidious aspect here is the “you”… Which “you” are we even talking about? Technology\nhas replaced the need for us to engage in human (i.e. flawed) activities like\nexperiencing our lives and memories, but what has it wrought upon the other? How can we know\nor like others when we cannot know or like ourselves in any intimate way? This “you”\nof the other is another casualty (or sacrifice) to the new gods. Whose tyranny\nwill be unlike anything we have ever seen in history. Erroding the very substance\nof interpersonal connection.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is my way of saying goodbye ‘cause I can’t do it face to face</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We have lost intimate connection to ourselves and contact with the other. How does such a life\nconclude? The way in which we approach the finality of our own demise is by doing the only\nthing we know. Even at the event of my death I will live on through my prized digital artifacts, that likely\nno-one will care to revisit or enage with. This is a peek through door of “The Whale” where the shame\nand humiliation of what little of ourselves remains is on full display.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No matter what happens now… today has been the most perfect day I’ve ever seen</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The most “perfect day”. This is the real kicker. Not only are we subject to the\nvortex of modern technologically that tears away at the essence of humanity, we like it. We choose it. We <em>desire</em> it.\nThe inhumanity loaded into the word “perfect” in this sentence is palpable. Humans are not perfect.\nHumans are imperfect by virtue of our humanity. And yet, through technology, we now seemingly have\nthe ability to attain perfection. This brings the ideas in “Videotape” closer to something of a “Blackmirror” episode than anything else. The genius\nof Radiohead is making “Blackmirror”-like content in 2007, 4 years before\nthe release of the series. There is a lot of modern literature that explores similar ideas but\n“Videotape” was, for me, an early iteration that turned out to be scarily accurate in many\nrespects. A critique and foreshadowing of the trends that technoligically mediated\ninteractions would contrive — Big Brother and Leviathan incarnate.</p>\n<p>Now, one critique that I could raise to the ideas explored in “Videotape” is that <em>technologically\nmediated</em> experience, when taken most broadly, must include <em>psychotechnologies</em>\nsuch as mathematics and spoken language (grammar and syntax). Why pick on\nthe crudeness of one technology (“red, blue, green”) when there are others that also <em>filter</em>\nand <em>mediate</em> the rawness of human experience. I think this is worth considering, but that\nultimately “Videotape” is not trying to say other forms of technology may also mediate\nexpierence but rather that this <em>one</em> form happens manifest in these particular\nperversions and mutations and that we were standing in front of the oncoming sandstorm\nof technologically mediated interaction that will envelop us — and it has. It will impoverish\nus, but we’ll let it. Because we choose it. Because we like it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Videotape by Radiohead","date":"June 07, 2025"}}},"pageContext":{"category":"music","slug":"/music/radiohead-videogame/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/music/on-the-dillinger-escape-plan/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On The Dillinger Escape Plan"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1122645626","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
