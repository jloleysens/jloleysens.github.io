In this idealised model there is not really\nmuch unexpected that could happen — other than the power socket being yanked out. Typically this level\nof instruction is not under consideration for day to day programming. It is too low level. Advances in\nthe field of hardware and software have enable programmers to combine over hundreds of thousands of these\nlower level instructions using text with semantic value to humans. Let’s call this the text <em>representation</em>\nof our program. It is one description of the program, and it happens to the be one that programmers interact\nwith the most.</p>\n<p>Where does this leave errors? Somewhere in between. The reality is, errors happen at different levels. It\ncould be that errors occur because a carelessly scripted section of an application which fails to consider\nan edge case, or it could be that the layers separating our text represe</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Errors","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"code","slug":"/errors/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/elastic-and-zdog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Elastic and Zdog"}},"next":null}}
