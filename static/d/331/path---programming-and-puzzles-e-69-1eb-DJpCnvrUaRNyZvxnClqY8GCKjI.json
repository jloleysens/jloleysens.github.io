He\npresents incisive commentary on the use of exhaustive typing enforced (and\npraised) by languages like Haskell. A part of the issue strict typing\nreveals, as he outlines for us, is that programming at a high-level is the\nprocess of automating tasks and procedures that exist <em>in a domain</em>.</p>\n<p>Programs excel at automating scripted, repetitive tasks. With the advent of\nmore advanced techniques such as Machine Learning we see computers automating\nfuzzy, high-level tasks. Such as, find this person in a crowd rather than add one and two. In a sense, programs can now create programs. Whatever the level of\nsophistication, programs still operate inside domains.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Programming and puzzles","date":"May 11, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/programming-and-puzzles/","previous":null,"next":null}}
