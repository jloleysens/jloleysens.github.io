In this idealised model there is not really\nmuch unexpected that could happen — other than the power socket being yanked out. Typically this level\nof instruction is not under consideration for day to day programming. It is too low level. Advances in\nthe field of hardware and software have enable programmers to combine over hundreds of thousands of these\nlower level instructions using text with semantic value to humans. This is enabled by <em>layering</em> concepts\nover <em>patterns</em> we see in these lower level instruction. This is called <em>abstraction</em> and is a very powerful\nidea in Computer Science. Travelling all the way up the onion we arrive at text we read and program. Let’s call\nthis the text <em>representation</em> of our program. It is one description of the program, and it happens to\nthe be one that programmers interact with the most.</p>\n<p>Where does this leave errors? Often, somewhere wedged between these layers. The reality is errors happen at different levels. It\ncould be that errors occur because a carelessly scripted section of an application failed to consider\nan edge case.
