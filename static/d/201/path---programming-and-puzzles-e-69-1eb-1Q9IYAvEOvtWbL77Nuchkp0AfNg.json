In it he\npresents incisive commentary on the use of exhaustive typing enforced by\nlanguages like Haskell. Strict typing in programming languages reveals, as he\noutlines for us, that at a high-level programming is the process of\nautomating tasks and procedures that exist <em>in an evolving domain</em>.</p>\n<p>Programs excel at automating repetitive tasks. With the advent of\nmore advanced techniques such as Machine Learning we see computers automating\nfuzzy, high-level tasks. On the spectrum from simple to sophisticated we may have\n“add these two numbers together” vs “recognise this person in this crowd of faces”. The thing both\nof these tasks have in common is that they exist within a specific problem space.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://degoes.net/articles/fp-is-not-the-answer\">An article</a> by John De Goes</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Programming puzzles","date":"May 11, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/programming-and-puzzles/","previous":null,"next":null}}
