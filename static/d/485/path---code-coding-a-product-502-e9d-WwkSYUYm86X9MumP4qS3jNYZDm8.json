This role, to my mind, fully entails the act of writing, maintaining and, if you are lucky, deleting code. As I have mentioned in <a href=/code/most-important>a previous post </a> the thing that is, hopefully, occupying your thinking as a software developer will be algorithms.</p>\n<p>Not all algorithms are equal. Some are far more stimulating than others and that is partly due to level of complexity but also the knowledge domain that the algorithm is embedded in. Creating an algorithm for parsing code semantics is rather different to an algorithm for a perceptron used in machine learning. At a basic level of sophistication these algorithms are not “hard” to code but their beauty becomes more apparent in their essential parts. The difficult part, by my estimation, is developing an intuitive understanding of the reason for the existence of each basic part. This requires domain knowledge which usually means careful study is required.</p>\n<p>The reason I mention all of this is because these are things I believe software developers should foster a deep care for. To take an analogy from the scientific world; writing code is like creating a hypothesis. You do it based on data (hopefully), you draw from pre-existing knowledge (hopefully), you submit your hypothesis for peer-review (hopefully) you revisit your hypothesis as time goes on (hopefully).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Coding a product","date":"August 29, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"code","slug":"/code/coding-a-product/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/code/most-important/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The most important thing a programmer does"}},"next":null}}
