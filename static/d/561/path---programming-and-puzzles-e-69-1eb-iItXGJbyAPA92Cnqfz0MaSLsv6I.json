He\npresents incisive commentary on the use of exhaustive typing enforced (and\npraised) by languages like Haskell. A part of the issue strict typing\nreveals, as he outlines for us, is that programming at a high-level is the\nprocess of automating tasks and procedures that exist <em>in a domain</em>.</p>\n<p>Programs are good at automating well-defined repetitive (or scripted) tasks,\nin well-defined domains. With the advent of more advanced techniques such as\nMachine Learning see computers automating tasks in more fuzzy domains. Either\nway programs, at the least the ones we care to keep around, operate inside of\nsome kind of domain. How well we understand a domain informs how well we can\nsucessfully automate execution of tasks or procedures. There are different\napproaches to getting to grips with a problem domain that I</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Programming and puzzles","date":"May 11, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/programming-and-puzzles/","previous":null,"next":null}}
