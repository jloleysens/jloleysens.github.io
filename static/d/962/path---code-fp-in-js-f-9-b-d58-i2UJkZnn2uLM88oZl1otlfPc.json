I enjoy the\nsimplicity of it. It tends to force you to think of one thing at a time. A\nquote that unlocked the power of FP for me is by Alan J. Perlis, as stated in\nClojure’s rationale<sup>1</sup>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have\n10 functions operate on 10 data structures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This idea, for me, shook the world of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). I am not\nconvinced that OOP has been rendered without use, but there is\ncertainly something to these composable units (functions) that\nunderstand a shared interface. Interfaces like arrays or lists. These are extremely simple\ndata structures that know nothing about your business logic. When we start creating\nour own functions that operate on arrays and return arrays we quickly gain the ability\nto express different sequences of higher-level operations. See Doug McIlroy’s solution\nto the problem of finding the frequency of different words in a text file<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<p>To top it off all of this is possible in JS - as in many other languages. What\nmakes it even more pleasant to write in JS is that functions are first-class\nvalues in the same way that objects or numbers are. This means we can write\nfunctions that take functions as arguments — a pattern that is used\nextensively in many applications to solve different problems.</p>\n<p>Taking the teachings of FP a step further we can create law-abiding functions. This is\na more extreme version of the idea I stated earlier about shared interfaces. See a library\nlike <a href=\"https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts\">fp-ts</a>. These laws mean that we can reason about\nthe flow of our functions in a way that is analagous to mathematic formlae.</p>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Listed as one of the points <a href=\"https://clojure.org/about/rationale#_object_orientation_is_overrated\">here</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/AkYDsiRVqno?t=875\">Talk section</a> by Stefan Tilkov.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"(Don't) write FP in JS","date":"March 21, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"code","slug":"/code/fp-in-js/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/code/elastic-and-zdog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Elastic and Zdog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/code/errors/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Errors"}}}}
