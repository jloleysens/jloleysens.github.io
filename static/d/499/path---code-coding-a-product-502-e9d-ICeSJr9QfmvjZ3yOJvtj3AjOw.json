This role, to my mind, fully entails the act of writing, maintaining and, if you are lucky, deleting code. As I have mentioned in <a href=/code/most-important>a previous post </a> the thing that is, hopefully, occupying your thinking will be algorithms.</p>\n<p>Not all algorithms are equal. Some are far more stimulating than others and that is partly due to the level of complexity but also the knowledge domain that the algorithm is embedded in. Creating an algorithm for parsing code semantics is rather different to an algorithm for a perceptron implementation used in machine learning.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Coding a product","date":"August 29, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"code","slug":"/code/coding-a-product/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/code/most-important/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The most important thing a programmer does"}},"next":null}}
