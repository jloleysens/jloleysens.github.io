In this idealised model there is not really\nmuch unexpected that could happen — other than the power socket being yanked out. However, this level\nof instruction is not under consideration for day to day programming. It is too low level. Advances in\nthe field of hardware and software have enable programmers to combine over hundreds of thousands of these\nlower level instructions. We have created and <em>layered</em> concepts over <em>patterns</em>. This is called <em>abstraction</em>\nand is a very powerful idea in Computer Science. Travelling all the way up the onion we arrive at the text we\nread and write. Let’s call this the <em>text representation</em> of our program. It is one description of the program,\nand it happens to the be one that programmers interact with the most, so also where our creative\nproblem solving efforts are implemented for the problem we are (hopefully) solving.</p>\n<p>Where does this leave errors? Sometimes wedged between the edges of the layers of abstraction — a message\nto a lower level lost in translation or misinterpreted. This class of error can either be very simple to fix,\njust use the expected method for passing a message down, or it can be deadly serious, in which case our\n<em>text representation</em> is on very shaky ground.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Errors","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"code","slug":"/errors/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/elastic-and-zdog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Elastic and Zdog"}},"next":null}}
