Most to whom I’ve played\nthis, or other <em>Chariot</em> tracks, have generally responded with a strong\naversion, disgust or incredulity that music like this exists. More\ninterestingly, this response is present regardless of whether the person in\nquestion listens to broader categories of alternative music (e.g., heavy metal) or not.\nI find these responses totally understandable — perhaps even a\ndesired outcome. It’s just a cacophony. And an especially obnoxious cacophony\nat that<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p>Regardless of your initial response, I’d like to invite you to consider\nmy case; that <em>The Chariot</em> presents unique art, painstakingly and\nlovingly crafted with an incisive message for modernity. <em>The Chariot</em>\nunpacks an interpretation of our modern milieu that is as shrewed as the\nmusic is unhinged — which is worth taking stock of. I submit to you\nthis post as my brief post-mortem review on <em>The Chariot</em>.</p>\n<p>Without delving to deeply into the origins and interlinked nature of music\ngenres it is worth noting that <em>The Chariot</em>’s roots are in punk rock.\nTelltale signs being present in song brevity, aggressiveness, minimalistic use\nof chords (at times) and charged lyrical content. Math Rock (syncopated,\nirregular rhythm sections) combined with punk roots create a hardcore sound\nalso present in bands like <em>Norma Jean</em> and, more along the Math Rock\ntangent, bands like <em>The Dillinger Escape Plan</em>.</p>\n<p>I first heard <em>The Chariot</em>’s music when I was in eleventh grade, back in 2009.\nTheir album <em>Wars and Rumours of Wars</em> had recently been released and a\nfriend of mine played the track “Daggers” to me. At the time the accompanying\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K05weZYExPU\">music video</a><sup>2</sup>\ndemonstrated that this band is not a typical group — they had something to\nsay. The insignificant cartoon army-men being dropped into the midst of war\nwith the sun happily(?) shining down on them depicts the way in which human life\nis undervalued by proud detached leaders. This particular song is clearly a protest against the powers that be with the repeated\nphrase: “War, it’s only skin deep”. Like many bands in the genre they sounded\nreally angry, but about what?</p>\n<p><em>The Chariot</em>’s first album <em>Everything Is Alive, Everything Is Breathing,\nNothing Is Dead, and Nothing Is Bleeding</em> is even a challenge to the\nconvention of album titles (at the time). By the time they released\n<em>One Wing</em> the music and presentation were honed to a razor sharp edge. With\ntracks “In” seasoned with\naphorisms: “We’re all capable of love, we’re all capable of cancer” and\n“Love.“‘s (one of all my all time favorites) lyrics “You fell in love [with the world], you fell\nasleep”. These lines reveal a theme: a reclamation of what was lost and\nsupremacy of individual decision-making while affirming the accompanying responsibility that come\nwith our decision-making powers — all delivered in a tongue-and-cheek manner.</p>\n<p>The band’s primary driver and creative force Josh Scogin went through several\nline up changes. He nurtured and maintained the band’s vision. Scogin is a\nself-proclaimed adherent to the Christian faith and his lyrics contain many\nreferences to Paul and Christ. However, in keeping with the nature of art,\nChristianity is not a prerequisite for resonating with lyrics like “We hold\nour breath as we pass everyone sleeping…” which occur in a meadow-like\ndream section of the track “Tongues”. This section speaks out as a call for\naction in the presence of overwhelming inaction, presumably apathy. As an\noverall body of art <em>The Chariot</em> is a Nietzschean grip around the shoulders\nand call for an honest evaluation of one’s life and surroundings with\nmotivation to consequent action.</p>\n<p>One gets the sense that this of music seeks to undo the confidence with which\nhumankind establishes and venerates it’s ideologies as superior and correct -\nto me this is particularly true of the West’s cultural pattern. <em>The Chariot</em>’s\nmusic warns against the dangers of oversimplification and can\ndepicts humanity grasping at straws, endlessly seeking for unifying theories\nbut only discovering paradox leading to deepening anxieties, unless we can\nsomehow awaken to our place in the world (whatever that may be).</p>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>I have seen exceptions to this rule, individuals with whom The Chariot resonate off the bat.
