The studio\nthat masterminded its creation, Naughty Dog, has dedicated an enormous amount\nof resources to creating this game. And I think what they have created reaches\nbeyond the scope of video game and deep into the realm of art and story telling.\nI would like to unpack this further, but as a preface I would like to state\nfrom the outset that I did not like a lot of the decisions that were made for this\ngame. I did not like it, but I still marvel at it.</p>\n<p>Before going any further, please note that <strong>this discussion contains spoilers</strong>.</p>\n<p>TLOU part II picks up some years after where the first game left off. With\nEllie and Joel still in Jackson. It seems their cross-country\ntravelling has settled into a routine much closer to the normality of the\nbefore-times. Albeit with the occasional patrol duty that has them fighting off\nany infected that threaten to encroach upon their haven. Children play in the\nstreets, warm fires are burning indoors and new relationships have burgeoned.\nIt is clear from the outset, however, that not all is well between Ellie and\nJoel. At this point only you know what Joel did back in Salt\nLake. This fact, one could imagine, has been eating away at Ellie’s trust for\nJoel over a number of years. You know she suspects Joels account to not be\ntruthful.</p>\n<p>For me, and for many others I would argue, the closeness and significance of\nthe relationship between Ellie and Joel becomes the linchpin and central\ndriving force for the decisions made in the first game. The first game ends\non a particularly melancholic note in this regard. Joel lies to Ellie about\nthe reason they left Salt Lake and that her gift of immunity could not be\nconverted into the gift of a vaccine for many. The weight of this can only\nbe known if you have played the first game, and I would strongly encourage\nnewcomers to do so.</p>\n<p>Joel is a cowboy. In the most classic and archetypal sense. He is a man of few\nwords and a countenance of impenetrabililty. Think back to the first game when\nJoel would brutally slaughter infected and adversarial non-infected alike only\nto offer a closing remark: “That’s that”. Pushing on into new hellish experiences\nof seemingly relentless violence and hopelessness. Hopelessness. Remember that word.\nIn the first game, the theme of hopelessness is central but Joel and Ellie represent\na defiance against it. Not one that is incorruptible. But one that is human and\ntenacious. Joel holds on to Ellie and Ellie holds on to the hope for a new future.\nThat equation is woven throughout the first game. But what happens when the new\nfuture demands a sacrifice Joel cannot make? He claims back his reason to live. Joel\nknows above all else what is required for his survival, and through the course of the\nfirst game that becomes Ellie.</p>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>SkillUp’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB20A8CitRU&#x26;\">review of the game</a>.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Last of Us Part II","date":"June 28, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"video-games","slug":"/video-games/tlou-part-ii/","previous":null,"next":null}}
