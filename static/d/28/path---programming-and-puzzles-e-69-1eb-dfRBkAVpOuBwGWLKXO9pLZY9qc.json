He\npresents incisive commentary on the use of exhaustive typing enforced (and\npraised) by languages like Haskell. A part of the issue strict typing\nreveals, as he outlines for us, is that programming at a high-level is the\nprocess of automating tasks and procedures that exist <em>in a domain</em>.</p>\n<p>Programs excel at automating repetitive tasks. With the advent of\nmore advanced techniques such as Machine Learning we see computers automating\nfuzzy, high-level tasks. On the spectrum from simple to sophisticated we may have\n“add these two numbers together” vs “recognise this person in this crowd of faces”. The thing both\nof these tasks have in common is that they exist within a specific problem space.</p>\n<p>In a sense, programs can now create programs. Whatever the level of\nsophistication, programs still operate inside domains.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Programming and puzzles","date":"May 11, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/programming-and-puzzles/","previous":null,"next":null}}
