He\npresents incisive commentary on the use of exhaustive typing enforced (and praised) by languages like Haskell. A part of the issue strict typing reveals, as he outlines for us,\nis that programming at a high-level is the process of automating tasks and procedures that exist in a <em>domain</em>. Programs are good at automating well-defined\nrepetitive (or scripted) tasks, in well-defined domains. With the advent of more advanced techniques such as Machine Learning see computers automating tasks in more fuzzy domains.\nEither way programs, at the least the ones we care to keep around, operate inside of some kind of domain. How well we understand a domain informs how well we can sucessfully automate\nexecution of tasks or procedures. There are different approaches to getting to grips with a problem domain that I</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Programming and puzzles","date":"May 11, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/programming-and-puzzles/","previous":null,"next":null}}
