I get\nthat on the one hand there is something really off-putting about having TODOs\nlittered all over your code base. Like threads of thought that did not have\ntime to fully develop and are now dangling appendages of what could have been\nif only someone had finished the job at time, but for whatever reason could\nnot. This, in my view, is a totally valid use of a TODO comment.</p>\n<p>At their worst TODOs are things that I would rather avoid placing in code\nfor other’s to pick up later or leave as an excuse for something half done.\nUsually a standard comment is more appropriate and should be used liberally\nin cases where code may be in a state that is hard for new readers to reason\nabout.</p>\n<p>At their best TODOs are indicators of future work <em>in the code itself</em>. It could\nbe a brief description of a feature or a simple indicator that standard protocol\nwas skipped for the sake of brevity — in my case writing front-end code may call\nfor the addition of high quality copy that end users will read, but may not be\nworth spending time on <em>now</em> because this version of your contribution (usually in\nthe form of a PR) is not finalized.</p>\n<p>I would like to propose that a TODO can be most effective not when the yet-to-be-built\nthing is ill-conceived, but rather it is precisely at its most useful when others\ncan read the code, encounter the TODO and exclaim “YES! <em>That</em> would be a great\nnext iteration”.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"TODO","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"code","slug":"/code/todo/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/code/either/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Errors and Either"}},"next":null}}
